# Welcome to Scheems

**Scheems** is an API generator for your relational databases.

!!! warning
    This project is a work in progress.

Scheems can create APIs that allow CRUD operations on your databases.
Database support is implemented with SQLAlchemy, while request validation is implemented with [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).

Just define your models with SQLALchemy, add them to Scheems, and you're good to go!
